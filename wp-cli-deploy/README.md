## Project maintainers welcomed
*April, 2016*

It just so happened that in the last year, my development interests shifted away from WordPress. As such, I ended up not writing a single line of PHP in over twelve months. 

I believe that the tools we build are best when we use them ourselves, and the reality is I don't use `wp-cli-deploy` anymore, so I decided to hand off maintenance of this project to someone else.

If youâ€™re interested in the gig, ping [me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/ciobi) and we can take it from there.

## WP-Cli Deploy 

__Current Version__: 1.0.0 (stable), 1.1.0-beta (in dev)

Deploys the local WordPress database or uploads directory.

The tool requires defining a set of constants in your wp-config.php file.
The constants should be prefixed with the environment handle which you will use as the first parameter for your desired subcommand. An example configuration for a "dev" environment:

```php
<?php
define( 'DEV_URL', 'the-remote-website-url.com' );
define( 'DEV_WP_PATH', '/path/to/the/wp/dir/on/the/server' );
define( 'DEV_HOST', 'ssh_host' );
define( 'DEV_USER', 'ssh_user' );
define( 'DEV_PORT', '22' );
define( 'DEV_PATH', '/path/to/a/writable/dir/on/the/server' );
define( 'DEV_UPLOADS_PATH', '/path/to/the/remote/uploads/directory' );
define( 'DEV_THEMES_PATH', '/path/to/the/remote/themes/directory' );
define( 'DEV_PLUGINS_PATH', '/path/to/the/remote/plugins/directory' );
define( 'DEV_DB_HOST', 'the_remote_db_host' );
define( 'DEV_DB_NAME', 'the_remote_db_name' );
define( 'DEV_DB_USER', 'the_remote_db_user' );
define( 'DEV_DB_PASSWORD', 'the_remote_db_password' );
define( 'DEV_POST_HOOK', 'echo "something to be executed when the command finishes"' );
```

=> `wp deploy push dev ...`

Not all commands / subcommands require all constants to be defined. To test what
a subcommand requires, execute it with a non-existing environment handle. e.g.
`wp deploy dump johndoe`.

You can define as many constant groups as deployment enviroments you wish to have.

__Examples__

    # Deploy the local db to the staging environment
    wp deploy push staging --what=db

    # Pull both the production database and uploads
    wp deploy pull production --what=db && wp deploy pull production --what=uploads

    # Pull both the production themes and plugins
    wp deploy pull production --what=themes && wp deploy pull production --what=plugins

    # Dump the local db with the siteurl replaced
    wp deploy dump andrew

### Installation

* Clone this repository in your WordPress directory.
* Create a `wp-cli.yml` file in the root of you WordPress directory with:
```yml
require: "relative/path/to/deploy.php"
```
* You can now use the deploy command. Type `wp help deploy` to see if it
works.

### Configuration

In order to be able to use the deploy command, you need to define certain
constants in your `wp-config.php` file.

#### Configuration Dependecies

Subcommands depend on different constants in order to work.
Here's the dependency list:

* __`wp deploy push`__: In order to push to your server, you need to define the
ssh credentials, and a path to a writable directory on the server. _These
constants are needed whatever the arguments passed to the `push` subcommand_:
    * `%%ENV%%_USER`
    * `%%ENV%%_HOST`
    * `%%ENV%%_PATH`

* __`wp deploy push %%env%% --what=db`__: In order to deploy the database to your
server, you need to define the url of your WordPress website, the path to
the WordPress code on your server, and the credentials to the database on
the server:
    * `%%ENV%%_URL`
    * `%%ENV%%_WP_PATH`
    * `%%ENV%%_DB_HOST`
    * `%%ENV%%_DB_NAME`
    * `%%ENV%%_DB_USER`
    * `%%ENV%%_DB_PASSWORD`

* __`wp deploy push %%env%% --what=uploads`__: In order to push the uploads directory,
you need to define the path to the uploads directory on your server:
    * `%%ENV%%_UPLOADS_PATH`

 __`wp deploy pull`__: In order to pull to your server, you need to define the
sh credentials constants. _These constants are needed whatever the arguments
assed to the `pull` subcommand_:
    * `%%ENV%%_USER`
    * `%%ENV%%_HOST`

* __`wp deploy pull %%env%% --what=db`__: In order to pull the database to from your
server, you need to define the url of your remote WordPress website, the
path to the WordPress code on your server, and the credentials to the
database on the server:
    * `%%ENV%%_PATH`
    * `%%ENV%%_URL`
    * `%%ENV%%_WP_PATH`
    * `%%ENV%%_DB_HOST`
    * `%%ENV%%_DB_NAME`
    * `%%ENV%%_DB_USER`
    * `%%ENV%%_DB_PASSWORD`

* __`wp deploy push %%env%% --what=uploads`__: As in the `push` command's case, in
order to pull the remote server uploads, we need their path on the server.
    * `%%ENV%%_UPLOADS_PATH`

* __`wp deploy push %%env%% --what=themes`__: As in the `push` command's case, in
order to pull the remote server themes, we need their path on the server.
    * `%%ENV%%_THEMES_PATH`

* __`wp deploy push %%env%% --what=plugins`__: As in the `push` command's case, in
order to pull the remote server plugins, we need their path on the server.
    * `%%ENV%%_PLUGINS_PATH`

* __`wp dump %%env%%`__: This subcommand only requires the path to the target
WordPress path and its URL.

#### `%%ENV%%_POST_HOOK`

You can __optionally__ define a constant with bash code which is called at the
end of the subcommand execution.

You can refer to environment variables using placeholders. Some of the
available environment variables are:
* `env`: The environment handle
* `command`: The subcommand (Currently `push`, `pull`, or `dump`).
* `what`: The what argument value for the `push` or `pull` subcommand.
* `wd`: The path to the working directory for the deploy command. This is
the directory where the database is pulled, and other temporary files are
created.
* `timestamp`: The date formatted with "Y_m_d-H_i"
* `tmp_path`: The path to the temporary files directory used by the deploy
tool.
* `bk_path`: The path to the backups directory used by the deploy tool.
* `local_uploads`: The path to the local WordPress instance uploads
directory.
* `ssh`: The ssh server handle in the `user@host` format.


__Example__

Here's an example of a `DEV_POST_HOOK` that posts a message to a hipchat
room after a `pull` or a `push` is performed using the HipChat REST API
(https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-cli).
For pushes, it also clears the cache.

```php
<?php
$hipchat_message = "http://%%url%%"
	. "\njeandoe has successfully %%command%%ed %%what%%";
$command = "if [[ '%%command%%' != 'dump' ]]; then "
		. "echo '$hipchat_message' | %%abspath%%/hipchat-cli/hipchat_room_message -t 1245678 -r 123456 -f 'WP-Cli Deploy';"
	. "fi;"
	. "if [[ '%%command%%' == 'push' ]]; then "
		. "curl -Ss http://example.com/clear_cache.php?token=12385328523;"
	. "fi;";
define( 'DEV_POST_HOOK', $command );
```
